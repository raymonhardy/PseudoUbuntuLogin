# PseudoUbuntuLogin

This website that looks like a default Ubuntu Desktop login. To make this hack work you will need to find a friends Ubuntu desktop or laptop that he had left open. Then open this website to full screen and it makes it look like his desktop is open to login. You will also need to make sure his laptop doesn't sleep. 

This project is still in progress
